SSS (stands for Super-Simple-Sample) Portfolio is a developer showcase built with 10 Kendo React components for a neat, interactive UI that highlights skills and projects. 

## Sections

- Intro: A dynamic opening with animations featuring my name and position.
- About: A brief introduction to who I am.
- Skills: A showcase of my technical expertise.
- Projects: Highlights of my key development work.
- Contact: A simple way to reach out to me.

## Components

ðŸ§© AppBar: Used for navigation at the top of the page.

ðŸ§© Avatar: Displays my profile picture in the pop-up message section.

ðŸ§© Badge + BadgeContainer: Used to attach a badge to the avatarâ€”I added a blue checkmark to indicate that Iâ€™m a verified applicant.

ðŸ§© Button: Navigation buttons placed in the AppBar.

ðŸ§© FloatingActionButton: Used for other buttons on the page. I know that a Floating Action Button is typically a fixed-position CTA button to keep it accessible throughout the user experience, but since it has a clean UI and a large, clear design, I used it as a button with a position: relative value in different sections of my portfolio.

ðŸ§© Typography: Displays text on the page.

ðŸ§© SvgIcon + Kendo React icon set: Enhances the visual appeal of interactive elements on the page.

ðŸ§© ProgressBar: Shows my proficiency levels for different skillsâ€”this is a creative way to use a ProgressBar beyond just indicating loading states.

ðŸ§© Fade animation: Adds a dynamic effect to my name in the contact section near the footerâ€“this idea was inspired by remix music videos.

ðŸ§© Slider: Adjusts the scrolling speed of the text mentioned aboveâ€“I treated it as a mini playground for users to experiment with.
